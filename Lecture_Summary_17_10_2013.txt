This lecture we started to analyze Software Configuration Managment. It is essential for well organized programmer. 
It allows us to manage our files: creating changes, seeing when changes were done, reverting changes, or sharing editable files with other people. 
We looked detailed on Centralized Version Control on GIT example. The images showing how does this mechanism works helped us understanding this system.  
We learned basic actions (add, checkout, checkin, head, revision and so on) and terms (repository, server, client, branch, merge, conflict and others) to manage GIT. 
We also learned more detailed about branching and merging which are one of the main mechanisms of GIT.
