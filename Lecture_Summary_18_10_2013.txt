This lecture we broaded our GIT knowledge. 
We learned about Distributed Version Control and its advantages in comparison to CVC. 
We discovered the core concepts like synchronising, tracking or backing up our files as well as downloading or uploading changes at separate steps. 
Important is the new terminology like push, pull or clone. 
These allows us to manage our files in new way. We learned why is DVC more profitable than CVC. 
However DVC has also its disadvanteges which we should remember. 
We also have seen how does GIT works in practice.
