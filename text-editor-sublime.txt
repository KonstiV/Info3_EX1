Sublime Text 2 - my favourite texteditor
http://www.sublimetext.com/

The features are amazing for example the Plugin for SASS(Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets - http://sass-lang.com/) which is very usefull to write fast CSS for Ruby, because you can use variables.
Sublime is a light-weight texteditor, so no waiting only coding/writing.

The most amazing features are:
- multiple selection 
- the command palette with short syntax commands
- the find an replace function with RegEx
- the fuzzy finder (control or command + p) to open files even faster than Vim and apps like PeepOpen
- that i can use my own Color Scheme
